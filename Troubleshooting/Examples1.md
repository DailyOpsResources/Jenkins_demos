**Here are few examples of a failed console output in Jenkins.** <br>
**In most of the cases you might want to get back to developer to fix the code, plugin erros, (or) fix network/permission issues.** <br>

1. In this example, the "Build" stage runs a build script that attempts to authenticate with a Docker registry (docker login). However, the authentication fails with an "unauthorized: authentication required" error. The console output indicates that the provided credentials (myuser and mypassword) are incorrect or insufficient for accessing the registry.
```
Started by user Robert Davis
Running on Development Agent in /var/jenkins/workspace/Build and Test
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Build)
[Pipeline] sh
Running build script...
+ docker login -u myuser -p mypassword
Error response from daemon: Get https://registry.example.com/v2/: unauthorized: authentication required

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: Build failed with an exception.
```

2. In this example, the "Deploy" stage executes a deployment script that uses the AWS CLI (aws s3 cp) to upload a file (myapp.tar.gz) to an S3 bucket (s3://my-bucket/). However, the upload fails with an "Access Denied" error. The console output indicates that the Jenkins user does not have sufficient permissions to perform the S3 upload operation.
```
Started by user Olivia Thompson
Running on Production Agent in /var/jenkins/workspace/Deploy to AWS
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Deploy)
[Pipeline] sh
Running deployment script...
+ aws s3 cp myapp.tar.gz s3://my-bucket/
upload failed: myapp.tar.gz to s3://my-bucket/myapp.tar.gz An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: Build failed with an exception.
```

3. In this example, the "Test" stage runs a test script using pytest. However, one of the tests encounters an HTTP error (401 Unauthorized) when trying to access a specific URL (https://api.example.com/data). The console output shows the error message, indicating that the request to the API was unauthorized.
```
Started by user Emily Davis
Running on Development Agent in /var/jenkins/workspace/Build and Test
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Test)
[Pipeline] sh
Running test script...
+ pytest
...
E       requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.example.com/data

...

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: Build failed with an exception.

```
   

4. In this example, the "Deploy" stage runs an Ansible playbook (ansible-playbook deploy.yml) to deploy an application. However, the deployment script fails with an "Authentication failed" error. The console output indicates that the provided credentials are incorrect or insufficient to authenticate with the target system.
```
Started by user Adam Johnson
Running on Production Agent in /var/jenkins/workspace/Deploy Application
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Deploy)
[Pipeline] sh
Running deployment script...
+ ansible-playbook deploy.yml
ERROR! Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and try again.

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: Build failed with an exception.
```
